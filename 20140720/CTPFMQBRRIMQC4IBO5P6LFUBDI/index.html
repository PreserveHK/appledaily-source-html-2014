On the night of 30 March, a Boer force led by Christiaan de Wet got into a ravine, and waited in ambush.<br>At first light the next morning, de Wet's artillery opened fire from some small hills, sending the British into confusion. As expected, the British retreated in the direction of the ravine, and suspecting nothing approached the ravine in small groups. As they did so, de Wet ordered them to surrender, and about 200 were captured. However, there was one lieutenant who refused to surrender. The following account was written by a war correspondent.<br>When told to surrender, the lieutenant bowed his head, and rode slowly back to his men. I imagine that in that brief time he bade farewell to life. De Wet covered him with his rifle. The lieutenant stopped in front of his men. "Fall back!" he commanded in a loud clear voice. The words were scarcely out of his mouth when de Wet shot him dead.<br>一九零零年三月桑納波斯之役，英軍和波爾軍交戰。三月三十日晚上，克里斯蒂安．德韋特率領一支波爾軍隊，走進一個峽谷，準備伏擊英軍。<br>第二天一早，德韋特的砲兵在一些小山上發砲，英軍大亂，一如所料，向峽谷撤退。他們不虞有詐，一小群一小群的走近峽谷，德韋特就叫他們投降，俘虜了約二百人。但是，有一個中尉不降。以下是戰地記者的敍述：<br>德韋特叫他投降。那中尉垂下頭，策馬轉身，慢慢向手下走去。我想，他在那短短一刻，跟生命說了再見。德韋特用來福槍指着他。他在手下跟前停下來，朗聲下令說：「往後退！」話才出口，他就被德韋特射殺。</p></body></html>
