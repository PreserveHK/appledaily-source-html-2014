Being well mounted, he soon distanced his men, but the Boer was well mounted too. Finally he gained on the Boer, who, seeing his men left miles behind, dismounted, ran up a small kopje, and began peppering the subaltern at about 100 yards. Luckily, he was not hit as he rode up to the kopje.<br>Now I forgot to mention that Palmer had gone out that day unarmed, not expecting to see Boers; so he rode up to within 20 yards of his man, pointed his pipe at him, and hollered, " Hands up!" The Boer obeyed, and Palmer marched him into camp. The Boer's rage at being taken by an unarmed man was most amusing, I am told.<br><em> 以下故事，出自波爾戰爭期間一名英國軍官的書信：</em> <br>第三十四連的帕爾馬中尉率領一小隊人前往偵察，看見一個落單的波爾人，和手下一起追趕。他的馬跑得快，不久就把手下拋在後面，而那波爾人騎的也是快馬。最後，那波爾人見帕爾馬逐漸趕上，而他手下又落後了幾英里，就翻身下馬，跑到一個小山上，距一百碼左右，向帕爾馬亂槍掃射。帕爾馬幸而沒有被擊中，繼續策馬走到山前。<br>我忘了說，那天早上，帕爾馬沒想到會碰見波爾人，沒有帶武器。他騎馬走到那波爾人二十碼之內，用煙斗指着他，高聲喊道：「舉手！」那波爾人聽命，給帕爾馬押着走到英軍軍營。據說，他後來發覺自己給一個手無寸鐵者俘虜，恨得咬牙切齒，非常有趣。</p></body></html>
