We looked for his horse and rifle, but the Boers had taken them and left him to his fate.<br>We got him some bread and jam, but he was too far gone to eat, and all he wanted was water. I got him a canteen full, but he did not drink, and kept pointing to his saddle bag. So we searched it, and found a bottle, and held that up. His eyes fairly glistened, and he even smiled, and looked so thankful. He tipped some of the stuff into the canteen, and it fizzed up like champagne. Then he handed us the bottle to have some. It was lemonade. We had a chat with him, and he was saying how tired of it all he was.<br><em> 波爾戰爭期間，一個英國士兵記述了以下一件事：</em> <br>我和一個燧發槍手四處走走，無意中見到一個波爾人。他病倒了，被同袍捨棄。我們試找他的馬和來福槍，但兩者都已給他的同袍取去，留下他自生自滅。<br>我們拿些麵包、果醬給他吃，但他病得太重，吃不下，只想喝水。我給他取到滿滿一水壺，他卻不喝，只是指着他的鞍囊。我們於是把鞍囊取過來，在裏面找到一個瓶子，拿起給他看。他眼睛發亮，臉上還露出微笑，一副感激神情。他把瓶中飲料倒進水壺，那飲料冒起嘶嘶作響的泡沫，有如香檳。跟着，他把瓶子遞給我們，叫我們也喝些。那原來是檸檬蘇打水。我們和他閒談了一會。他說，對整場戰爭厭倦得很。</p></body></html>
