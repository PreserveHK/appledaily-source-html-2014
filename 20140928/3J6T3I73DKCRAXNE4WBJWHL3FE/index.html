The smile was constantly on his face.<br>"What is the matter? This does not strike me as a subject for laughter," I said.<br>"Excuse me, doctor, but I lost my arm in so funny a way that I still laugh when I look at it," was the reply. "Our first sergeant wanted shaving, and got me to attend to it, as I am a corporal. I had lathered him, took him by the nose, and was just about to apply the razor, when a cannon ball came, and that was the last I saw of his head and my arm! Excuse me, doctor, for laughing so, but I never saw such a thing before."<br><em> 以下一段記述，見《軍醫筆記》，所述是一八一二年英美交戰期間英軍圍攻伊利城堡事。</em> <br>我記得，有一天巡視病房，一個病人向我舉起切去前臂的手，並失聲大笑。他一直微笑盈腮。<br>我說：「怎麼啦？這樣的事，我不覺得有趣。」<br>他回答：「對不起，醫生，但我失去前臂的方式很滑稽，至今想來，仍然發笑。我們那個軍士長當時要刮鬍子，叫我這個做下士的效勞。我給他塗了肥皂泡沫，執着他的鼻子，正要下剃刀，就飛來一枚砲彈。從此我再也看不到他的頭顱，以及我的手臂。醫生，對不起，我忍不住笑，因為從來沒有見過這樣的事。」</p></body></html>
