To this the officer replied: "Sir, I beg to inform you that I do not ride a crow: I ride a horse." This brought him the extra grant.<br>牙買加在英國統治期間，一名高級軍需官致函陸軍部說：「上公園營地至紐加塞①，路程十七英里。僕每星期須往紐加塞三次，一匹馬實難勝其任，故欲添一馬，謹請增加飼料津貼。」<br>他不久就收到覆函：「閣下申請增加飼料津貼事，恕難照准。蓋上公園營地至紐加塞，按『鴉飛直線』②路程計算，不過十英里耳。謹奉副國務大臣之命，奉覆如上。」那軍需官回信說：「僕所乘者，馬也，非鴉也，伏乞明察是幸。」他終於獲得額外飼料津貼。<br>① Up Park Camp和Newcastle，俱為牙買加英軍駐守之地。<br>②As the crow flies是成語，指「成直線地」。</p></body></html>
