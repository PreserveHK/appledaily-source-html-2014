The former was only slightly wounded, while the latter seemed to be almost at the end of his tether.<br>The Gordon Highlander was examining his companion when he saw the Boer making a sign as though wanting a drink. Without hesitation, he pulled out his flask, and handed it over to the dying man. The latter had sufficient strength to raise the flask to his lips and drink, and in handing it back to the Highlander, he also handed over his belt, which was afterwards found to contain a sum of ten pounds.<br>英國和波爾人戰爭期間，《納答爾時報》記者有以下一段記述：</em> <br>伊蘭斯拉特戰役之後，一名戈登高地軍團士兵和一個波爾人靠近躺在地上。那蘇格蘭高地人只是輕傷，而那波爾人則似乎已是命若風燈。<br>那蘇格蘭人望着身旁的波爾人，見他做了個手勢，似是要喝水，就毫不猶豫，拿出水瓶，交給那垂死的波爾人。那波爾人還有力舉瓶到嘴邊喝，喝罷，把水瓶交還，並附贈自己的腰帶。那蘇格蘭人後來發覺，腰帶藏有十鎊的錢財。</p></body></html>
