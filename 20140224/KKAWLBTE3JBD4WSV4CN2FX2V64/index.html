On one occasion, Wellington, commander-in-chief of the British forces, ordered some riflemen to take a hill occupied by the French. He told them to fire, but with a loud voice one old soldier replied, "No firing," and holding up the butt of his rifle, tapped it in a peculiar way. At the signal, which meant "we must have the hill for a short time", the French quietly retired, though they would not have done so if they had been fired upon.<br>It should be noted that this signal would never have been made if the hill had been capable of permanent defence, so well did veterans understand war and its proprieties.<br>半島戰爭期間，英法士兵和氣相處的例子不少。有一次，英軍總司令威靈頓要一些來福槍手攻取法軍扼守的一座山，下令他們開槍，一個老兵卻高叫「不要開火」，同時舉起槍托，用手敲打，敲打方式很特別。這是個信號，表示「這座山，我們必須佔領一會兒」。法軍一見，不開一槍就撤走。假如英軍向他們開火，他們可不會這樣輕易退去。<br>值得一提的是，假如這座山可以長期據守，進犯的英軍絕對不會發出這樣的信號。可見老兵多麼了解戰爭的本質和規矩。</p></body></html>
