A puff of smoke told him where his Boer counterpart was.<br>Waiting cautiously until he caught a glimpse of the Boer, Sampson fired, and was so satisfied that he had hit his target that he incautiously raised his head and, as a result, received a bullet in the neck.  The Boer, in his turn convinced that his opponent was dead, rose on his knees, and was at once struck in the shoulder by another of Sampson's bullets, but before he dropped, he fired again and lodged a bullet in Sampson's side.  Thus the duel continued until each man became unconscious, and was found some time later in an almost dying condition.  Both combatants recovered, however, and got to know each other well.*<br>一八八一年波爾戰爭期間，英軍神槍手桑普森有一天藏身巨石之後，正準備狙擊波爾將士，一顆子彈在他頭頂呼嘯而過，打掉他的帽子。桑普森看見遠處一縷硝煙，知道那波爾神槍手藏身之地。<br>桑普森小心翼翼的等候，終於瞥見對手，一槍打去。他深信必然命中，一時大意，擡起頭來，脖子就吃了一顆子彈。這一趟，是那波爾神槍手以為對手死了，跪着挺起身子，卻給桑普森一槍打中肩膀，但倒下之前還了一槍，打中桑普森脅部。他們這樣槍來槍往，直到雙方都昏倒，獲救時，也都已命若游絲。不過，兩人後來都康復，還結為朋友，十分相熟。*<br>*那波爾神槍手就是博塔（Louis Botha），後來成為著名的軍人和南非第一任總理。</p></body></html>
