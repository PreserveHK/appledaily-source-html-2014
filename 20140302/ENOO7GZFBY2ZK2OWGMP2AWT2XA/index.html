His comrades afterwards refused to speak to him, considering him not manly enough. Thereupon Horenden went up to his colonel one morning, and publicly called him a fool. He was, of course, again sentenced to be flogged.<br>That night, the corps was attacked by the French. Horenden was desperately wounded, but seeing his colonel in the hands of one of the enemy, he shot the Frenchman and liberated his officer. After the attack was repelled, Horenden got ready for his flogging in the morning. Unfortunately, during the night he died from his injuries, and his desire to prove his manliness was not gratified.<br>半島戰爭期間，英國二等兵霍倫登因犯軍規，被處笞刑，捱九尾鞭捱到第二十下，昏厥過去。他的同袍認為他缺乏男兒氣概，事後都不跟他交談。於是，霍倫登一天早上走到上校跟前，當眾叫他做「獃子」。他當然又被判處笞刑。<br>那天晚上，法軍來襲，霍倫登受了重傷，但看見上校落在敵人手上，就開槍射殺那人，救回上校。法軍被擊退之後，霍倫登準備第二天早上受笞刑。可惜他當晚就因傷重死亡，未能如願證明他的男兒氣概。</p></body></html>
