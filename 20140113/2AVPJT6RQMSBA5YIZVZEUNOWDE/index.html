The Connaught Rangers were ordered forward to the critical point. Their colonel, Wallace, rode in front of his men, and told them what they were to do. "When you arrive at the spot I shall charge," he said. "The rest must be done by yourselves. Press on them to the muzzle,  I say. Connaught Rangers -- press on to the rascals!" And "press on" the Rangers did, and the confounded French regiments were hurled back in disorder.<br>Wellington saw all this. He galloped up, and gripping the colonel by the hand said, "Wallace, I never saw a more gallant charge than that just made by your regiment!"<br>一八一零年葡萄牙布薩科之役，威靈頓指揮的英葡軍隊有一部分敗退，三個法國軍團乘勢追殺。科諾特突擊隊奉命迎敵，穩住陣腳。突擊隊的華萊士上校策馬走在士卒之前，告訴他們要做些什麼：「一去到那兒，我就會衝鋒。此後怎麼做，要靠你們自己了。科諾特突擊隊各弟兄，我們要向着他們的槍口直迫過去，把那些流氓迫退！」突擊隊員果然就「直迫過去」，那三個法國軍團倉皇潰退。<br>威靈頓目睹這一切。他策馬跑前，抓住華萊士的手說：「上校，我從來沒有見過這樣英勇的衝鋒。你的軍團剛才教我開了眼界。」</p></body></html>
