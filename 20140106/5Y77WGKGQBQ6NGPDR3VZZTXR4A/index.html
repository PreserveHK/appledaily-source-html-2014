A few days before the battle, British and French soldiers lived on the most amicable terms. They bathed together in the stream that separated the two armies, and an exchange of rations, such as biscuit and rum, was by no means uncommon.<br>And in the interval between the first and second days' fighting, soldiers from both sides went to the banks of the stream for water. They threw down their caps and muskets and chatted together like old acquaintances. Some French soldiers helped the British carry away the wounded, and some British soldiers also helped the French. When the bugles sounded the recall, many of the rival soldiery shook hands before parting. And in ten minutes they were again charging one another with the bayonet.<br>一八零九年西班牙塔拉維拉戰役之前幾天，英、法士兵相處十分融洽，在相隔兩軍的一條河一起沐浴，並經常交換餅乾、蘭姆酒等口糧。<br>而第一、二天激戰之間，有一段休戰時候。雙方士兵都到河畔取水，脫下軍帽，放下毛瑟槍，像老相識那樣閑談起來。有些法國士兵協助英軍擡走傷者，有些英國士兵也同樣協助法軍。到歸隊號角響起，雙方士兵不少都握手道別。十分鐘之後，他們又拿着刺刀，向對方衝殺。</p></body></html>
