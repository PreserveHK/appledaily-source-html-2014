He got out at a station for refreshment, and ordered a small bottle of champagne.<br>When the waiter was about to draw the cork it flew with a sharp  "pop" in the direction of his lordship's face.  He at once made a dodge to escape it.  Seeing this, a ruddy-faced farmer facetiously exclaimed, "Ye wouldna ha' done to ha' beane in the Crimean War."  Naturally this remark caused Lord Cardigan to smile, but he did not enlighten the farmer as to his identity.<br>一八五四年，在克里米亞戰爭之中，卡迪根勳爵率領英軍輕騎兵旅奮勇衝向俄軍砲兵隊*。有一次，他前往蘇格蘭，途中在一個車站下車吃點心。要了一小瓶香檳酒。<br>侍者正準備把瓶塞拔出，那瓶塞突然「砰」的一聲彈起，朝卡迪根臉上飛去，卡迪根馬上一閃避開。一個紅光滿面的農場主人看見，打趣說：「克里米亞戰爭的時候，像你這樣，怎能上得戰場。」卡迪根聽到這話，不禁笑起來，但他沒有把自己的身分告訴那農場主人。<br>*The charge of the Light Brigade（輕騎兵旅衝鋒）在英國史上十分著名，七百名衝鋒者只有一百九十五人生還。英國十九世紀大詩人丁尼生（Alfred Tennyson）為這次衝鋒寫過一首頌歌，使之更加膾炙人口。</p></body></html>
