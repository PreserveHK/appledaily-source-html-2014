A private of the Natal* Mounted Rifles had his horse shot, and immediately cried out, "I'm hit!"<br>"Nonsense, man; it's only your horse," exclaimed a comrade, and the man, accepting the assurance, went on fighting. He returned to the camp with his corps, strolled about in the evening, suffered during the night from what he called "spasms", and only next morning discovered that a Mauser bullet had gone clean through his body! Then he collapsed and was taken to hospital.<br>一八九九年十月，英軍和波爾人戰於里特方丹，戰地記者留意到一件奇事。話說納答爾*來福槍騎兵團一名二等兵的坐騎中槍，他立刻高叫：「我中槍了！」<br>他的一個同袍說：「別儍，兄弟。你的馬中槍而已。」那二等兵相信了他的話，繼續戰鬥。他隨騎兵團一起回營，黃昏後來回走動，到了夜裏，受他所謂「陣陣痙攣」所苦。第二天早上，他才發覺一顆毛瑟槍子彈利利落落，洞穿了他的身體。他隨即倒下，送了去醫院。<br>*納答爾位在南非，東臨印度洋，一八四零年代成為英國殖民地，今為南非共和國之一省。</p></body></html>
