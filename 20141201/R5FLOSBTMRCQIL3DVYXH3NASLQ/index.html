In one of the public parks of Montreal, she saw an old cannon standing in a small enclosure guarded by a British soldier.  Interested in what appeared to be an old relic, she questioned the man about it.<br>"That cannon," the soldier replied, with a swagger and a wave of his hand, "was captured by the British troops from the Americans at the Battle of Bunker Hill.  We keep it here in memory of the victory."  The battle took place in June  1775 during the Americans' siege of Boston early in the American Revolutionary War.<br>For a moment the fair American was staggered, and then she answered, with spirit, "That's all very well, but at any rate we have the hill!"<br>美國一年輕女郎漫遊加拿大，當時加拿大還是英國殖民地。她在蒙特婁一個公園看見一小圍欄，旁邊有一英兵守衞，欄內是一尊殘舊大砲，似是古物。她感到興趣，向那英兵請教。<br>那英兵揮揮手，神神氣氣回答說：「這尊大砲，是英軍在邦克山之役從美軍手上奪得的，放在這裏，紀念那場勝仗。」一七七五年六月邦克山之役，是美國獨立戰爭初期美軍圍攻波士頓的一場戰爭。<br>那漂亮的美國女郎一時張口結舌，但隨即昂然回答：「那很好，不過，無論如何，邦克山今天卻是在我們手上。」</p></body></html>
