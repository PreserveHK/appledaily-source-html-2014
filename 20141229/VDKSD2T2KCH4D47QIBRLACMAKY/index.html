One of the Boers pursued the same tactics. As Sandy rose once more to fire, he received a bullet through his hand, and in his surprise gave a loud yell.<br>"Serve you right, Sandy. You were told not to show yourself," an officer lying nearby said.<br>"Nae doot, sir, nae doot," groaned Sandy; "but hoo did I ken he was gaun to fire oot o' his turn?"*<br>一八八一年波爾戰爭期間，一個蘇格蘭高地人和一個波爾人開槍決鬥。<br>當時英、波雙方軍人，都藏身掩護處，但上述那個叫桑迪．麥克唐納的蘇格蘭人，總是要站起來，隨意開一槍，隨卽伏下。一個波爾人也是如此。桑迪再一次站起來準備開槍，一隻手給子彈洞穿。他愕然大叫一聲。<br>他身邊一個軍官說：「桑迪，這是活該。早就叫你要掩護身體。」<br>桑迪呻吟着說：「不錯，不錯，但誰知道還未輪到他，他就開槍？」<br>*這是蘇格蘭英語，等於：No doubt, sir, no doubt, but how did I know he was going to fire out of his turn?</p></body></html>
