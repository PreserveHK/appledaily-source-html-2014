They almost stood up in their saddles, and, bringing down their swords with great weight, clove the heads of many of the enemy down to the chin.<br>An amusing story is told of the conflict. In those days the soldiers were taught the sword exercise with great regard for regularity, each cut being followed by its corresponding guard. A doctor, dressing a wound on a dragoon's head, asked, "How came you to get this ugly cut?" The dragoon replied, with much warmth, "I had just cut 5 at a Russian, and the damned fool never guarded at all, but hit me over the head!" Number 5, it may be explained, was a body cut.<br>一八五四年巴拉克拉瓦之役，英軍龍騎兵主要襲擊敵對俄國軍人的頭顱。他們據鞍半立起來，高舉長劍，用力劈下，把不少敵兵的頭顱劈開，直到下巴。<br>戰役留下一個可笑故事。當年，教授士兵劍擊之術，着重常規，這樣砍就那樣擋，每一招都有法度。一個醫生給一名龍騎兵包紮頭上劍傷，問道：「你怎麼會給砍成這個樣子？」那龍騎兵忿忿不平說：「我向一個俄羅斯軍人用第五砍，但是，他媽的那個混蛋不擋不拒，揮劍逕向我頭顱劈下來！」這裏須解釋一下：第五砍是砍身軀的招式。</p></body></html>
