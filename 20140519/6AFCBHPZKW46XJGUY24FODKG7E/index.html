While lying down the blood came from my ears, mouth, and nostrils. Eventually I was so exhausted with firing that I fell sound asleep, and dreamt that I was at Yarmouth, the well-known seaside resort!② Waking up, I found the firing still going on, and forthwith joined in the fray again."<br>波爾戰爭期間，英軍一個後備軍人寫信給在倫敦的朋友，談到連場戰役之中所經歷的一些不尋常細節。<br>他寫到莫德河之役①：「我在敵軍砲火之下，十多小時沒有水喝，而且烈日高懸。當時我伏在地上，耳朵、口、鼻孔都有血流出。最後，我開槍開得累了，沉沉入睡，夢見自己身在著名的海濱度假勝地雅茅斯② ！我醒過來，發覺槍火還未停止，就馬上又加入戰鬥。<br>①莫德河之役，英軍和南非波爾軍交戰，由凌晨打到下午，英軍雖然獲勝，卻傷亡枕藉。<br>②雅茅斯位在英格蘭東岸。Resort作動詞，指「（經常）去」，例如：Many people resort to the seaside in summer（不少人夏天會去海濱）。遊客等常到的地方，於是就叫做resort。</p></body></html>
