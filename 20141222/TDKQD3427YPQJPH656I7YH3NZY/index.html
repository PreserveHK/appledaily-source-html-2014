A gentleman in plain clothes rode up to him and said, "Can I be of any use, sir?"<br>Wellington looked at him and instantly said, "Yes; take this pencil-note to the commanding officer," pointing to a regiment in the heat of the engagement. The note was taken and delivered, its bearer galloping through the thick of the fight to execute his commission.<br>After the battle Wellington made every inquiry, but never could find out to whom he was indebted for this brave service. He said this was one of the most gallant deeds that had ever come under his notice, seeing that it was done without prospect of honour or reward.<br>滑鐵盧戰役之中，威靈頓公爵手下副官相繼傳令去了，一時間，他左右再無一人。一個舉止溫文的男人，身穿便服，策馬走到他跟前，說道：「公爵，我可以效勞嗎？」<br>威靈頓望望他，馬上說：「可以。這裏有一紙鉛筆寫的便條，請送給那邊的指揮官。」他用手指着一個酣戰中的軍團。那人接過便條，策馬飛奔，走進擾攘的兵戈之中，把便條交與軍團指揮官，完成任務。<br>戰後，威靈頓四處打聽，都查不到是誰那樣勇敢，為他傳令。他說，那是他少有見到的英勇行為，因為那人不是求榮譽，也不是求報酬。</p></body></html>
