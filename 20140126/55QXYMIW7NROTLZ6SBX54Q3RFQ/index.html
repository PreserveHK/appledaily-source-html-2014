"Cousin," replied Louis with a smile, "when one is so loaded with laurels, it is of course difficult to walk."<br>歷來君主稱譽沙場奏凱的將領，情詞之盛，很少有如法王路易十四之譽孔代親王路易二世．德波旁。<br>一六七四年，孔代在西尼菲戰役之中，和奧蘭治親王威廉率領的荷蘭、德意志、西班牙聯軍交鋒。這是他打的最後一場戰役。他回到凡爾賽宮，路易十四為表尊崇，走到御階頂相迎。<br>戰功彪炳的孔代患嚴重痛風，幾乎無法走上御階，要路易十四等候，連聲請罪。路易十四微笑着回答：「親王，一個人肩負着那麼多的勞耀，舉步維艱，有什麼奇怪。」</p></body></html>
