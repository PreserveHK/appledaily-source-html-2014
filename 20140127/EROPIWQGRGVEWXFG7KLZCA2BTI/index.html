Before the fight began, the Scots fell upon their knees and prayed for victory.<br>"They kneel!" exclaimed some of the English soldiers, who were witnessing the scene from their own positions. "They beg for mercy!" "Do not deceive yourselves," answered a Scottish noble loyal to King Edward of England. "They beg for mercy, it is true, but only from God."<br>Mistakes on the part of the English resulted in the Scots obtaining a great advantage. And when the English, mistaking a party of boys who rushed towards the field for the sake of plunder for a new Scottish force, fled from the scene, the Scottish victory was complete.<br>一三一四年六月的班諾克之戰，是蘇格蘭第一次獨立戰爭之中一場重要戰役。戰鬥之前，蘇格蘭將士跪下來，祈求勝利。<br>英軍在他們的陣地看到這情況，有些就說：「他們下跪，乞求憐憫！」一個忠於英王愛德華的蘇格蘭貴族回答：「不要自欺吧。他們的確是乞求憐憫，但只是乞求上帝憐憫。」<br>英軍犯了一些錯誤，以至蘇格蘭軍隊佔盡上風。最後，英軍看見一群少年往戰場跑來，不知道他們只是要搶掠，還以為是蘇格蘭的生力軍，慌忙逃竄。蘇格蘭於是大獲全勝。</p></body></html>
