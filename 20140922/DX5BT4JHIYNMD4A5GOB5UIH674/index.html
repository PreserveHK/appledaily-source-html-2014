"I'm done for now, padre," he cried.<br>The parson went to the side of the man, where, kneeling with his back to the enemy, he began to pray. An officer shouted out, "Come back and lie down, sir! You've no right to risk your life in that way."<br>"This is my place," replied the parson, "and I'm doing my own special work." Then he went on praying and reading words of comfort from a Bible, until the soldier's eyes closed in death. Fortunately, the good man, though exposed to the Boer marksmen during his administration, was not once hit.<br>一八九九年貝爾蒙特戰役之中，一英國軍團猛攻波爾人扼守的一座小山，一名士兵受傷將死，痛得打滾，見到隨軍牧師，就喊道：「牧師，我這回完蛋了。」<br>那牧師走到他身旁，跪下來，背向敵軍，開始祈禱。一個軍官高喊：「牧師，快回來伏下。你不能這樣用生命冒險。」<br>那牧師回答：「這正是我應該在的地方，而我正在做分內的工作。」說罷，他繼續祈禱，並誦讀《聖經》上給人慰藉的文字，直到那士兵閉目逝去。這個善心牧師履行職責時，雖然一直暴露在波爾人槍下，卻始終沒有中槍。</p><p>【動LIVE】萬人罷課　蘋果全程直播:<br>和平佔中:  http://occupycentral.appledaily.com <br>YouTube:  http://bit.ly/occupycentral </p></body></html>
