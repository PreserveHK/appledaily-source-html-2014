During the Boer War*, a British division was passing a Boer farm when some of the soldiers stepped out of the ranks and confiscated a couple of geese, and a drummer unheaded his drum and put the birds inside.<br>Shortly afterwards the colonel, noticing the silence of the drum, rode up to the drummer and asked, "Why don't you beat that drum?" The startled drummer whispered, "Colonel, I have got a couple of geese in here." Without showing the least surprise, the officer said, "Well, if you are sick you need not play."<br>That night the diplomatic colonel had roast goose for supper.<br>行軍時候，將士饑餓，禁止掠奪的命令，全軍上下都不會嚴格遵從。波爾戰爭*期間，一師英軍走過一個波爾人的農場，有些士兵離隊，「充公」了兩隻鵝。一個鼓手把戰鼓揭開，放了那兩隻鵝進去。<br>不久，上校發覺那個鼓沒有響，策馬走到那鼓手跟前，問道：「你為什麼不打鼓？」那鼓手吃了一驚，低聲說：「上校，鼓裏面有兩隻鵝。」上校沒有露出絲毫驚訝神色，說道：「嗯，你不舒服，不打鼓也罷。」<br>那天晚上，這位圓滑的上校有烤鵝作晚餐。<br>*波爾戰爭是一八九九年到一九○二年英國與南非波爾人的戰爭。</p></body></html>
