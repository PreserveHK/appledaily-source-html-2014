He speedily distinguished himself by succouring the wounded under fire.<br>His most notable deed was when, seeing a colonel in danger of falling into the hands of the Americans, he pressed him to mount his own horse, and then proceeded in the direction of the enemy, waving a white handkerchief. The American general asked Jackson who he was. He replied, "I am an assistant surgeon. Many of our men are wounded and in your hands. I come, therefore, to offer my services in attending them." He was sent to the rear as a prisoner, and he spent the first night in dressing the wounded, taking the shirt off his back for bandages. He also attended the wounded Americans. Washington soon sent him back to the English lines, not only without exchange, but even without requiring his parole.<br>蘇格蘭外科醫生羅伯特．傑克遜濟世為懷，美國獨立戰爭期間，自薦為英軍效力。他在槍火之下，救援傷者，不久就深孚眾望。<br>他有一件事最值得一記：有一次，眼見一個上校將落入美軍手中，就力請那上校跨上他的馬逃走。他自己則揮着白手帕，向敵方走去。美軍那位將領問他是誰，他回答說：「我是個助理軍醫。我軍不少人傷了，並在你們手上。我是來照料他們的。」他被當作戰俘，送到後方，第一晚就忙着給傷者包紮傷口，把自己的襯衫撕破，作繃帶用。他還照料美國傷兵。華盛頓不久就把他送回英軍陣營，不但不用交換戰俘，甚至沒有要他答應不再為英軍出力。</p></body></html>
