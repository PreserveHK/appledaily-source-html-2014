However, some of the Colonials were too keen to allow opportunities to go by without seizing them.<br>One morning, the colonel of a Colonial corps saw one of his men wending his way to camp, carrying in his arms a sturdy Boer cock.  Halting him, the officer asked the man if he had come by the fowl honestly.<br>"Well, colonel," was the reply, "I just saw the old fellow sitting on a wall, and I ordered him to crow for Old England.  He wouldn't, so I confiscated him for a rebel."<br>波爾戰爭期間，英軍嚴禁搶掠，將士也都沒有違背這禁令。不過，南非英國殖民地的軍人，有些見到機會，即不能白白放過。<br>一天上午，一個殖民地軍團上校看見一個士兵抱着一隻肥壯的波爾公雞回營，就把他叫住，問他是不是以誠實方法取得這隻雞。<br>那士兵回答說：「嗯，上校，我見到這老傢伙蹲在牆頭上，命令他為我英國啼叫，他卻不肯。我於是把這個英國叛徒沒收。」<br>*To leave nothing to be desired是成語，指「毫無缺點」，反義說法是to leave much to be desired，即「缺點很多」，例如：His English leaves much to be desired（他英文很差）。</p></body></html>
