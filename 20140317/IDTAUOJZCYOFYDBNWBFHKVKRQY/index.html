In their search for gold, the men broke furniture, and gutted houses. Many things which cannot be mentioned happened to the women of the unfortunate city. Even churches were robbed. One soldier's wife was found to have an under-petticoat of red velvet, evidently the covering of a communion table.<br>In the cathedral, a spacious vault had been converted into a spirit depot for the French garrison. The casks had been perforated by musket-balls, and their contents escaping, formed a pool of some depth. Three British soldiers drank their fill, and becoming intoxicated, fell head foremost into the liquor. They were suffocated.<br>一八一二年四月，英軍從法軍手上奪得西班牙巴達霍斯城，隨即大肆搶掠，四處搜尋黃金，既把傢具搗毀，又把無數房子內部翻得七零八落。這個不幸城市的婦女，也遭到難以言宣的劫難。即使教堂都被搶掠。一個士兵的妻子，給發現有一條紅天鵝絨內裙，那材料明顯是聖餐桌的桌布。<br>大教堂之內，有個大地下室，給法國駐軍用作酒窖。酒桶給火槍子彈洞穿，酒流滿地，有如一個頗深的酒池。三個英軍開懷大喝，喝醉了，一頭倒在酒池之中，窒息而死。</p></body></html>
