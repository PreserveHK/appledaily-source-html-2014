Attached to each company was a Portuguese cook, and when the food was cooked, it was divided into portions as nearly equal as was possible.  Then an old soldier would stand with his back towards the dinners, while another took up each portion in succession, saying, "Who shall have this?"  The answer would be "Jackson", "Roberts", and so on, until everyone's name had been called out.  All this seemed very fair, but the Portuguese cook invariably received the smallest portion!<br>When the soldier who was asking "Who shall have this?" got a small portion into his hands, he would ask with a peculiar intonation, and the other soldier would reply, "Portuguese boy."<br>半島戰爭期間，英軍分配糧食，有一個習慣。當時每一連軍隊，都有一個葡萄牙廚師；食物煑好之後，就盡可能平均分為多份。這時，一個老兵會背向這多份晚餐而立，另一老兵則依次拿起一份份的食物，問道：「這份給誰？」背向食物而立者會說「傑克遜」、「羅伯茨」等等，直到所有人的名字都叫了一遍。這一切似乎很公平，但是，那葡萄牙廚師總是拿到最小的一份！<br>問「這份給誰」的那個士兵，拿起的食物假如份量特別小，發問時聲調會忽然變得很古怪。背向食物而立者就會說：「那個葡萄牙小夥子。」</p></body></html>
