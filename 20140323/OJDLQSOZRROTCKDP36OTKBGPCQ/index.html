The French spent hours in singing and drinking, and, in very high spirits, shouted expressions of defiance at the British, who, on their part, were silent and sorrowful. Two days before, at the Battle of Quatre Bras, many a good British soldier had fallen, and no man knew what the morrow was to bring forth.<br>Great care was taken to keep the British sober. Lord Albermarle said, "Prior to taking up our position for the night of the 17th, the regiment (14th Foot） filed past a large tubful of gin. Every officer and man was, in turn, presented with a little tin-pot full. No fermented liquor that has since passed my lips could vie with that delicious schnapps. When every man was served, the contents that remained in the tub were tilted over on to the ground."<br>滑鐵盧戰役前一晚，敵對兩軍的表現截然不同。法軍連續幾小時唱歌喝酒，意氣風發，向英軍高喊，出言不遜。至於英軍，卻是沉默哀傷。兩天之前的夸特布拉斯一役，英軍傑出的將士不少陣亡，而未來一天更不知會怎樣收場。<br>英軍着意不許將士喝醉。阿爾伯馬爾勳爵說：「十七日晚上，走上岡位之前，我們軍團（第十四步兵團）列隊走過一大桶杜松子酒，各將士一一領取一小錫壺的分量。我此後再也沒有喝到這麼美味的酒。人人喝過之後，酒桶就給推倒，餘下的酒都流到地上。」</p></body></html>
