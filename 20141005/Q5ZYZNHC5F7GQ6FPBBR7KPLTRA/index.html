"Your 58-pounder gun," said the bearer, "is a beautiful gun, but we think we have one as good. We should like to have a fair duel with her." The challenge was accepted, and everything arranged for   12 o'clock next day.<br>When the time came, all the batteries ceased firing. The British gun detachment mounted the parapet and took off their hats, saluting the Russians, who returned the compliment. The English gun was given the first shot, as the senior one; it struck the side of the Russian embrasure. Then the Russians fired   - a very good shot, too. Several more shots were fired from both sides. At length, with the seventh British shot, the Russian gun was knocked clean over. The Russians mounted the parapet and took off their hats in acknowledgment of defeat. All the batteries on either side then opened fire again.<br>克里米亞戰爭期間（一八五三年至五六年），俄軍有一天遣使向英軍說：「你們那尊五十八磅重砲彈的大砲，很了不起；不過，我們也有一尊，相信同樣出色，想跟你們那一尊公平比個高低。」英軍接受挑戰，約定第二天十二時決鬥。<br>到了約定時間，雙方砲兵一起停止發砲。英軍大砲支隊走到胸牆上，向俄軍脫帽致意，俄軍照樣回禮。英軍那門大砲資歷較深，獲許先發第一砲，擊中俄方牆上那砲眼的一側，俄軍隨即還砲，那一砲也很厲害。雙方繼續發了幾砲互轟。最後，英軍發第七砲，把俄軍那尊大砲完全擊倒。俄軍走到胸牆上，脫去帽子，承認敗北。兩軍砲兵隨即又全面開火。</p></body></html>
