In  1694, during the War of the Grand Alliance, Marlborough ordered Tollemache to attack the French port of Brest. There were reasons which made Tollemache very doubtful of success, and he represented to Marlborough that the only chance of it lay in a surprise. Still the duke ordered him to attempt it.<br>The attack was an utter failure. Although Tollemache led his troops with great gallantry, they were beaten off with heavy losses. Tollemache, himself wounded, succumbed to his injuries, and died in Plymouth in June  1694. It was afterwards found that the French had been warned by Marlborough of the coming attack.<br>約翰．邱吉爾是第一任馬爾伯勒公爵，也是十七世紀英國著名將領。湯瑪斯．托爾馬什將軍由於戰功彪炳，和他堪稱一時瑜亮。一六九四年，在大聯盟戰爭期間，馬爾伯勒命令托爾馬什率兵奪取法國港口布雷施特。托爾馬什觀察形勢，認為難以成功，向馬爾伯勒說，除非出法軍不意，不可能取勝。但馬爾伯勒還是要他一試。<br>結果英軍大敗。托爾馬什雖然驍勇，軍隊還是被擊退，死傷枕藉。托爾馬什自己也受了傷，一六九四年六月因傷死於普里茅斯。後來發現：馬爾伯勒把進襲計劃事先通知法軍。</p></body></html>
