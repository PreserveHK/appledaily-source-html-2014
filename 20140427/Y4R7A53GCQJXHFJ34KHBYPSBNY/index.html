"No, no," exclaimed the adjutant, recognising by the voice that he had made a mistake, "of course not. What a fool I am." "Yes, sir," replied the staff sergeant habitually, as he saluted and strode away.<br>樸次茅斯*幾英里之外，有一個軍旅營地，其中一營軍隊的副官患近視，幾乎整天都戴一個單眼鏡。一天晚上，他從軍團辦公室走出來，恰巧沒有戴眼鏡，看見一位上士走過，以為是他剛遣人召喚的樂團中士，就喊道：「樂團中士！樂團中士！」<br>那上士見附近無人，就轉過身，敬禮，說道：「對不起，副官，我不是樂團中士。」那副官憑聲音發覺自己叫錯了人，連聲說：「對，對，你當然不是。我真糊塗。」那上士循例回答：「是的，副官。」他再次敬禮，轉身大步離去。<br>*樸次茅斯是英國南部一個軍港。</p></body></html>
