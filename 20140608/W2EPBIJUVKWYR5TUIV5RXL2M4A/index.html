Colonel Benson, mortally wounded, was carried back to camp. He sent for Major Sampson, and said, "Defend your camp for all it is worth. The Boers have stated that they will attack in the morning with 1,400 men unless you surrender." The Boers, however, did not attack.<br>Benson was one of the kindest-hearted officers in the service. Some time before his death, he was chasing some of the enemy when one of them fell behind his comrades. Benson called upon him to surrender. As the Boer, a very young man, refused to stay his flight, Benson eventually fired at him. The young man was hit, but pluckily spurred his horse on. Benson caught him, however, and dragged him from his horse, seeing for the first time that he was severely wounded. Hastily carrying his prisoner to a doctor, he said, "For God's sake, make this man live."<br>一九零一年十月三十日，英軍和波爾人交戰，死傷枕藉。本森上校受傷將死，擡回軍營，把桑普森少校叫來，說道：「波爾人聲言，除非你們投降，否則明天一早，會出動一千四百人來犯，你怎樣都要守住啊。」<br>本森宅心之仁厚，軍官之中少見。他死前不久，曾追逐敵軍，其中一人落在後面。這個波爾人很年輕，本森叫他投降，他卻不肯停下來。最後，本森開槍，把他打中，他仍然奮勇策馬向前。本森抓住他，把他拖下馬，這才發覺他受了重傷。本森連忙帶這個戰俘去看醫生，說道：「行行好，不要讓他死去。」</p><p>【壹錘定音】星期一至五，早上8點開咪！<br> http://hammerout.hk <br><br>立即更新《蘋果動新聞》app<br> https://bitly.com/AppleDailyiOSApp <br> https://bitly.com/appledailyandroidapp </p></body></html>
