Just as I was nearing one of the Boers, he dodged me, but I was after him, and although he ran fast I soon got near him. When I was within a few paces of him, he turned round and was preparing to fire at me.<br>Then I saw he hesitated, and, to tell the truth, I hesitated too, for I could see he was a young Jew. But it was only for a moment. I suppose it was the habit one gets into when meeting a Jew -- the face is familiar, and one thinks one may know it. But I remembered it was Briton versus Boer, and, Jew or no Jew, it is all the same in war, so I did my duty. I heard the poor chap say something in Hebrew as I stabbed him, but I quickly put him out of misery.<br><em> 波爾戰爭期間，英軍一個猶太士兵寫信回家，談到一場戰鬥。</em> <br>我們奉命持刺刀衝鋒，清剿戰壕裏的敵軍。我衝向一個波爾人，他連忙逃避，我窮追不捨。他雖然跑得快，不久還是給我趕上，相去不過幾步。他轉過身，準備向我開槍。<br>我見他有點猶豫；事實上，我也如此，因為看得出他是個猶太少年。但這猶豫無非轉眼間的事，也許可說是我們久已養成的習慣：見到猶太人，覺得很面善，或恐是相識。但我馬上記起這是英國人對波爾人之戰，無論對方是不是猶太人，都是一樣。我於是做了應做的事。那個可憐的少年給刺刀刺中時，用希伯來語說了些話。但我很快就結束了他的痛苦。</p></body></html>
