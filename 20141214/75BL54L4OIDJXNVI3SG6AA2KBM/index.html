A relief force sent to its help was attacked by the Zulus before it reached Eshowe, and Colonel Northey of the King's Royal Rifles was severely wounded.<br>In spite of the wound, which he received about half way through the action, the colonel refused to leave his men, but he eventually fell fainting* to the ground from loss of blood. The surgeons dressed his wound, and the colonel returned to consciousness with the shouts of victory ringing in his ears, proclaiming the flight of the enemy. The colonel suddenly raised himself on one hand and joined in the shouts of his men, thus bursting the bandaged wound, and causing violent haemorrhage to recommence. The result was that four days later the colonel died, to the great grief of both officers and men.<br>一八七九年南非的英祖戰爭期間，英軍一隊步兵在艾斯豪遭祖魯人包圍。英軍援兵趕往艾斯豪途中，也遭襲擊，皇家來福槍隊上校諾西身受重傷。<br>諾西是在戰鬥半途受傷的，傷後卻不肯丟下士卒離去，終於因失血過多，昏倒地上。軍醫給他包紮傷口之後，諾西醒過來，聽見同袍歡呼勝利，說敵人已經抱頭鼠竄。他猛然一手撑起身子，和同袍一起高聲歡呼，結果包紮好的傷口迸裂，再度大量出血，四天之後，一命嗚呼，軍中上下都深感悲痛。<br>*To fall fainting的fall，這裏作連繫動詞（link verb）用，有「陷入某狀態」含義。常見的to fall asleep（入睡）、to fall sick（病倒）、to fall silent（沉默下來）等，都是這個用法。</p></body></html>
