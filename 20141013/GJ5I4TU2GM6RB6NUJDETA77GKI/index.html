Tearing a leaf from his pocketbook, he hastily wrote on it the following urgent message:  "In great danger. Enemy pressing hotly. For Heaven's sake send us some ammunition." He dispatched the message by an orderly, who went away at full speed.<br>After considerable delay, the messenger returned, and handed to the officer an official document. His feelings may be imagined when, on opening it, he read the following extraordinary statement:  "All communications to this department must be written on foolscap* paper with a two-inch margin."<br>克里米亞戰爭期間，英軍一個無險可守的重要稜堡遭俄軍猛烈突襲，負責該堡的英國軍官眼看彈藥不足，連忙從小筆記本上撕下一頁，寫下緊急短信：「形勢危急，敵軍猛攻。盼速送彈藥來此。」他派個勤務兵把短信送去。那勤務兵匆匆出發。<br>經過不少耽誤，勤務兵回來了，把一份公文交給軍官。軍官開緘，看見以下一句不尋常的話，其感受可想而知：「與本部門通訊，必須使用大頁紙，頁邊留兩英寸空白。」<br>*Foolscap由fool's cap（小丑帽）兩字合成，指寬十三英寸、高十七英寸的紙。從前，這種紙印有小丑帽的水印，因此就叫foolscap paper。</p></body></html>
