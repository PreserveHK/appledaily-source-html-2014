One market day a rustic, paying an infrequent visit to the place, was much interested in these guns, so much so as to attract the notice of a soldier, who not only volunteered information regarding them in glowing terms, but also offered to sell them to the rustic at a very small price. The rustic, thinking it would be pleasant to have such relics at his home, passed the purchase price over to the soldier, who promptly disappeared.<br>The next day, the rustic arrived with a two-horse dray to remove the cannon, but he was immediately pulled up by a policeman, who, when he had heard the account of the affair, said, "It's you and not the guns that are sold, my friend."<br>克里米亞戰爭時期用過的兩門殘舊攻城砲，在蘇格蘭一個鎮上街頭展出。一天市集，一個鄉巴佬偶到鎮上，對這兩門大砲深感興趣，一個士兵見狀，自動上前，用最美麗的言詞，介紹這兩門大砲，還說可以賣給他，價錢便宜得很。那鄉巴佬心想，家裏放兩件戰場遺物，也真不錯，就把錢交給那士兵。那士兵隨即溜掉。<br>第二天，那鄉巴佬駕着一輛運貨雙馬車到來，要把大砲搬走，卻馬上遭一名警察制止。他說明原委，那警察告訴他：「朋友，給賣掉的是你，不是這兩門大砲。」</p></body></html>
