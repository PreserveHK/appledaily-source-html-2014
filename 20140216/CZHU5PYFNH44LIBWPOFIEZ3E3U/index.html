One yeoman officer, whose temper was anything but mild, vigorously abused a recruit for some trifling error. He was surprised to hear the indignant recruit reply, "Confound it, sir! I'll raise your rent for this!" The recruit was the officer's landlord.<br>When the same corps was returning from a march, the colonel, on coming to a crossroads, gave the order, "Straight on!" Almost immediately he missed the trampling of hoofs, and turned to find himself alone with the trumpeter. "Why, where the deuce is the regiment?" he asked. The trumpeter replied, "Gone down Martin's Lane, sir. It's a bit shorter that way."<br>英國受到拿破崙來犯威脅，國內因而成立義勇騎兵團。一個義勇騎兵軍官脾氣暴躁，見一名新兵犯了輕微過失，就厲聲痛駡。令他愕然的是，那新兵憤憤不平，回答說：「可惡，軍官！我非要你多交點租不可！」那軍官原來是那新兵的租戶。<br>又有一次，這個軍團行軍之後，回程時，走到岔路口。上校下命令說：「繼續向前直走！」但他幾乎立刻就發覺身後的馬蹄聲消失了，轉頭一看，見隨行的只有一個喇叭手。他問：「嗯，他奶奶的，軍團去了哪裏？」喇叭手回答：「他們沿馬丁徑去了。那段路程比較短。」</p></body></html>
