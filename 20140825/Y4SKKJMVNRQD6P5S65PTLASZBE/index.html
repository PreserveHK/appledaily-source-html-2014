On presenting himself, he was asked how he came to return the salute, knowing full well he was not entitled to it. Not in the least embarrassed, he promptly answered, "Sir, I always return everything I am not entitled to!" The colonel, surprised by the NCO's ready wit, laughingly dismissed him.<br>都柏林一名軍士走進軍營，營門負責放哨的年輕士兵誤認他的軍階，馬上向他掮槍致敬。那軍士不知道他的上校就在背後，舉手回禮──這其實是不容許的。<br>他回到宿舍，發覺有命令要他去見上校，心中納罕。上校見到他，問他說，明知不應獲敬禮，為什麼還要回禮。那軍士不慌不忙，應聲回答說：「上校，凡是不應該獲得的東西，我都會奉還。」上校見他反應敏捷，頗感驚訝，笑着把他遣去。<br>*Sentry-go和come to the shoulder都是軍隊用語，一指放哨的職責，一指把槍擱在肩膀上。「執行放哨工作」可說to be on sentry-go或to do sentry-go。</p></body></html>
