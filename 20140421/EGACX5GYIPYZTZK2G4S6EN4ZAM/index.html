A feud existed for some years, for instance, between the Royal Highland Regiment and the Rifle Brigade, and it was said to be a menace to peace for the two corps to be stationed in the same town.<br>A story is told of a soldier of the Royal Highland Regiment who, at a theatre, in passing a private of the Rifle Brigade, stepped heavily and, perhaps intentionally, upon the foot of the latter. Up sprang the rifleman. "You stepped on my foot!" he hissed. "Weel," said the Highlander apologetically, "I did ma best tae leap ower it, but a Hielan' mon is only human. I'm nae a kangaroo!" A fight immediately ensued. However, these feuds remained in abeyance when the regiments concerned were fighting a common enemy.<br>從前，英軍一些軍團互相爭競，宿怨頗深，例如皇家高地軍團與來福槍軍旅多年不和，倘駐守同一城市，據說會不利治安。<br>相傳有以下一個故事：戲院裏，皇家高地軍團一個士兵，在來福槍軍旅一名二等兵跟前走過，用力踏步，踏在那來福槍手腳上：這恐怕是故意的。那來福槍手跳起來，咬牙切齒說：「你踩在我腳上！」那高地人一臉歉意說：「嗯，我本已盡力躍過尊腳，但高地人無非人類，能力有限。我不是袋鼠！」兩人馬上廝打起來，不過，對付同一敵人的時候，這些軍團會把宿怨暫時放下。</p></body></html>
