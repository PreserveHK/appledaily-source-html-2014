In 1869 the 75-year-old politician was living in the United states. He had in mind a scheme to raise money for a revolution in Mexico by selling chicle. Upon meeting an inventor named Thomas Adams, he painted a rosy picture of how they could both make a fortune by turning chicle into a low-priced rubber substitute. Adams agreed to give it a try. He spent a year experimenting on the chicle, but to no avail.<br>Santa Anna ended up going back to Mexico. Adams was ready to dump the useless chicle when he walked into a drugstore and saw a little girl ordering chewing gum made out of paraffin wax. Remembering that Mexicans chewed chicle, Adams thought he might turn his stash into chewing gum.<br>Chewing chicle proved far superior to chewing wax. "Adams New York Gum Number 1" became hugely popular. It was the first modern chewing gum.<br>墨西哥獨裁者聖安納一八五五年遭放逐。一八六九年，這個七十五歲政客時居美國，計劃賣糖膠樹膠，賺錢在墨西哥搞革命。他和發明家湯瑪斯．亞當斯見面，鼓其巧舌說，糖膠樹膠要是製成便宜的橡膠代用品，兩人就都可以發財。亞當斯答應一試，但做了一年實驗，了無成果。<br>聖安納最後回到墨西哥。亞當斯也準備把無用的糖膠樹膠丟掉。有一次，他走進雜貨店，看見一個小女孩要買石蠟製成的口香糖，心想，墨西哥人有嚼糖膠樹膠習慣，他所存樹膠未必不可作口香糖的材料。<br>嚼糖膠樹膠無疑遠勝嚼石蠟。「亞當斯紐約第一口香糖」大受歡迎，成為現代口香糖的鼻祖。</p></body></html>
