The weather was then vile, and Girard took the dragoon's warning lightly. He jocosely remarked that the British "lay too long a-bed to be stirring so early" on such a morning. When discovery was no longer to be dreaded, the British gave a loud cheer, and the pipers of the Highland regiments, with some spirit of waggery, struck up the Highland tune, "Hey, Johnny Cope, are ye wakken yet?"  Before long, Girard's army had ceased to exist.<br>一八一一年半島戰爭的阿羅約德諾斯戰役，希爾將軍率領英軍，突襲吉拉爾將軍麾下法軍，幾乎把全軍殲滅。<br>十月二十八日，天還未亮，一名龍騎兵告訴吉拉爾說，一群人正在迫近。當時天氣惡劣，吉拉爾不把那龍騎兵的警告當作一回事，還打趣說，在這樣一個早晨，英軍不會「那麼早起牀」。英軍潛近，到再也不怕被發現的時候，就齊聲歡呼，蘇格蘭軍團的風琴手更流露了一點詼諧，奏起《喂，約翰尼．科普，你睡醒了麼》這首蘇格蘭歌曲。不久，吉拉爾的軍隊就化為烏有。</p></body></html>
