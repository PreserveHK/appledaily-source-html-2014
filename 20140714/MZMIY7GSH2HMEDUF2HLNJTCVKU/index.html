The moment a man on either side emerged from his cover he was at once the target of the enemy's bullets.<br>A Boer, partly, it seemed, in bravado, made a sudden sally to join a neighbour. An Englishman, who had long watched the rock, took aim and brought the daring one down. So delighted was he that he threw himself on his back and kicked his heels upwards. In his transport* one heel rose above the rock, and his fluttering ankle was instantly transfixed by a bullet sent from the rifle of a Boer.<br>波爾戰爭彼得山一役，英兵和波爾軍人都伏在巨石之後：大片土地上，這些巨石縱橫交錯。一有人走到石頭掩護之外，馬上就成為敵方子彈的目標。<br>一個波爾人似乎有點想賣弄勇氣，突然從巨石之後衝出來，要到鄰近的同袍身邊。一個英兵盯着他那塊巨石已經多時，立刻瞄準，開槍把這大膽的波爾人打倒。他高興得仰天一躺，揚起雙腿，一時忘形，一隻腳後跟伸得高於巨石，晃動的腳踝馬上給一個波爾人手上來福槍發出的子彈擊中。<br>*Transport這裏不可解作「交通」，而是「忘形」的意思，to be transported with delight / to be in a transport（或in transports）of delight即「樂極忘形」。</p></body></html>
