Describing the fight at the Coa in 1810, Simmons says in his book</em>  A British Rifleman.<br>I was shot through the thigh, which caused me to fall with great force. For a few moments I could not collect my ideas, and was feeling about my arms and body for a wound, until my eye caught the streams of blood rushing through the hole in my trousers.<br>I was carried to the rear, where a private of the 43rd Light Infantry had been placed on a palliasse of straw, and was dying. But when he saw me laid near him on the bare stones, he earnestly asked me to lie on the palliasse beside him. I have experienced many such kindnesses from soldiers. If I had not, I should not be alive to tell the tale.<br><em> 半島戰爭的大小戰役，英國少校喬治．西蒙斯幾乎都有上陣。滑鐵盧一役，他也有參戰。他撰寫的《英國─來福槍兵》一書，談到一八一零年科亞河之戰：</em> <br>我大腿遭子彈洞穿，整個人重重摔倒，最初有點迷惘，遍摸手臂、身軀，看看傷在那裏，後來才看到鮮血從褲管一個破洞迸出。<br>我給擡到後方。第四十三輕步兵團一個二等兵也在那裏，躺在草褥上，重傷垂死，但看見我給放在草褥附近的硬石地上，卽懇切邀我和他一起，共卧草褥。士兵這樣的恩情，我有多次體會，否則不可能活到今天，說這些故事。</p></body></html>
