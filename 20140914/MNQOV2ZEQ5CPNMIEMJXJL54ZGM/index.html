The poor fellow retorted that he was perfectly willing to go on, but at that moment was too paralysed with fear.<br>Major Sampson galloped on, but shortly afterwards was surprised to see the trooper charging past him.   "What's the matter?" shouted the major.<br>The trooper showed that his moustache and part of his upper lip had been carried away by a Boer bullet, and yelled fiercely,   "Where are the devils? Let me get at them!" With that he galloped on, and was in front of the charge the whole way.<br><em> 一八九九年，英軍和波爾人戰於伊蘭斯拉特，其中一事，可笑可哀，謹述於後。</em> <br>英國皇家輕騎兵團少校桑普森看見一名騎兵躺下來，命令他向前。那可憐傢伙回嘴說，他很想前進，但這一刻心驚肉跳，動彈不得。<br>桑普森繼續策馬急馳，過了不久，卻見那騎兵疾馳而過，向前衝鋒。他感到奇怪，高聲問道：「是什麼一回事？」<br>那騎兵回過臉，桑普森這才看見他的鬍子和一部分上唇給波爾人的槍彈轟掉了。那騎兵狠狠的說：「那些鬼子在哪裏？我非給點厲害他們看看不可。」說罷，他繼續策馬急馳，衝鋒一路領先。<br>*Get at someone有「抓住某人」或「襲擊某人」的意思，例如：He ordered his dog to get at the man（他命令他的狗襲擊那人。）</p></body></html>
