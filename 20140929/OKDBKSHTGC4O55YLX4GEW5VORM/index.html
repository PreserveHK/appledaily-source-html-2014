The colonel quickly decided on his course of action.<br>"Sergeant major," he exclaimed, "tell all the men who don't want to go to church to fall out②." A large number of the men quickly and gladly availed themselves of the privilege.<br>"Now, sergeant major," said the colonel, as soon as the movement had ceased, "dismissed all the men who did not fall out, and march the others off to church - -  they want it most!"<br>馬爾他一英國軍團列隊準備往教堂校閱，但教堂當時正在修葺，容不下所有士兵。軍團上校稍一沉吟，就決定該怎麼辦。<br>他喊道：「軍士長，叫所有不想去教堂的人離開隊伍。」大批士兵馬上高高興興，離隊而出，不放棄這權利。<br>上校待不想去者都離隊之後，說道：「軍士長，把沒有離隊者解散，然後叫其餘的人列隊到教堂去。最應該去教堂的，正是他們。」<br>①To draw up是「使……排列成隊」，例如：The students were drawn up into three rows（學生排成三行）。<br>②To fall out指「離隊」或「解散」，反義詞是to fall in，例如：The officer ordered his men to fall in / fall out（軍官下令士兵列隊／解散）。</p></body></html>
