In the midst of it a flock of wild geese flew down between the opposing lines and veered close to the Russian entrenchments. Some of the Russian soldiers began to fire at the geese, but not one of the birds was hit.<br>The geese then flew towards the French position. A young lieutenant, Cullet by name, took a rifle from a soldier's hands, fired, and brought down a goose. At once a shout arose from the Russian entrenchments, "Good for the Frenchman. Hurrah! Hurrah!"<br>Cullet wanted the goose. He took a ramrod, tied his handkerchief to its end, held it up, stepped boldly out into the space between the armies, picked up his goose, and made a profound bow to the enemy. During all this time not a shot was fired. But as soon as Cullet had gone back to his own trenches, the murderous fire was redoubled.<br>克里米亞戰爭期間，一天上午，法俄兩軍火槍交戰正酣，有雁群飛下，在兩軍之間，而較接近俄軍。有些俄兵向雁群開火，卻一隻都沒有打中。<br>雁群跟着飛近法軍。一個叫屈勒的中尉，從士兵手上拿過來福槍，開槍一響，擊落一隻。俄軍陣營馬上響起一片歡呼：「這法國人厲害，好槍法，好槍法！」<br>屈勒想撿起那隻雁。他拿一根推彈桿，以手帕繫其一端，舉起來，大膽走到兩軍之間，撿起射落的雁，並向俄軍深深一鞠躬，其間沒有人開一槍。但屈勒一回到法軍戰壕，奪命的槍火又再連綿不絕。</p></body></html>
