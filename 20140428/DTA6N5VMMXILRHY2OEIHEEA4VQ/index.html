"It is an order, colonel," replied the lieutenant. "Ah, indeed!" said his superior, "who, for goodness sake, could have given you such an order?" "My grandmother, colonel," was the reply. "Your grandmother!" ejaculated the colonel, bursting out laughing; "what is her name?" "Her Majesty Queen Victoria, Queen of England," answered the lieutenant, who was none other than Prince Albert. The colonel promptly disappeared, having no further questions to ask!<br>在柏林一個舞會上，普魯士一名上校走到一個年輕英國中尉跟前，那中尉襟上佩戴的一枚大勳章鑲滿鑽石。<br>那上校一臉傲慢神氣，說道：「年輕人，你胸前佩戴的，是什麼東西？」中尉回答：「是個勳章，上校。」上校追問這個較低級的軍官：「啊，是個勳章！老天，是誰給你這樣一個勳章？」中尉回答：「是我祖母，上校。」上校忍不住呵呵大笑，失聲說：「你祖母！她叫什麼名字？」中尉回答：「他叫維多利亞女王，英國的女王。」原來他就是阿伯特王子。那上校馬上走開，再也沒有什麼要問了。</p></body></html>
