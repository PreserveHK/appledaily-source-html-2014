His death is thus described by a war correspondent:</em> <br>Colonel Vandeleur, a young man and keen soldier, had but recently returned convalescent from England. He was on the train when it was stopped by an explosion. The instant Vandeleur regained his feet, realising what had happened, he put his head into the ladies' compartment, calling to them hastily, "Lie down; if you want to save your lives, lie down!"<br>He then went towards the open door to the platform, and came face to face with a bearded Boer, who had with another sprung upon the carriage. Vandeleur called to the man, "There are women and children in here." However, without a word for answer the Boer levelled his gun and shot the colonel through the heart. Vandeleur fell forward, dying instantly without a moan.<br><em> 一九零一年八月，波爾人在沃特瓦襲擊一列火車，射殺英軍上校范德勒。一個戰地記者記述了范德勒之死：</em> <br>范德勒是個勇於任事的年輕軍人，往英國療養了一段時期，最近才康復回來。爆炸令列車停下來的時候，范德勒正在車上。他一站起來，知道是什麼一回事，馬上伸頭進女乘客車廂，急忙喊道：「伏下來，要活命就伏下來！」<br>跟着，他走向開了的車門，要往月臺，迎面碰到一個留了鬍子的波爾人。這人和另一波爾人早些時跳了上車。范德勒對他說：「車廂裏有婦人、孩子。」那波爾人也不回答，舉槍就射穿了范德勒的心臟。范德勒向前便倒，馬上死去，哼都沒有哼一聲。</p><p>識睇 一定睇蘋果嘅足動世盃： <br> http://worldcup2014.appledaily.com/ <br></p></body></html>
