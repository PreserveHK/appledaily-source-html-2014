An officer noticed two of the men firing with anything but William-Tell-like＊ precision. He approached then, angrily exclaiming, "You fellows don't know the way to shoot; lend me a rifle, and I'll show you."<br>"Bang" went the gun, and the target was missed altogether. The two privates grinned, but the officer was equal to the occasion. Turning to one of the two privates, he remarked with a frown: "That's the way you shoot, sir." He then fired again, and again missed. Turning to the other private, he continued: "And that's the way you shoot, sir." Taking aim for a third time, he fortunately scored an "inner." He said triumphantly: "And that's the way I shoot."<br>多年前，約克郡一個步兵營舉行射擊比賽，一名軍官看見兩個士兵連百步穿楊的邊都沾不上，就走到他們跟前，怒道：「你們不懂射擊。把來福槍借給我，我給你們示範。」<br>槍聲「砰」的一響，完全沒有射中靶子。那兩名二等兵咧嘴而笑，但那軍官不慌不忙，皺着眉頭，轉身對其中一人說：「老兄，這就是你的槍法。」他再開一槍，依然沒有射中，於是轉身對另一人說：「而這就是你的槍法，老兄。」他第三次瞄準開槍，幸而射中內圈，得意洋洋說：「而這則是我的槍法。」<br>＊William Tell（威廉．泰爾）是瑞士傳說中的神箭手，曾射下放在兒子頭上的蘋果。</p></body></html>
