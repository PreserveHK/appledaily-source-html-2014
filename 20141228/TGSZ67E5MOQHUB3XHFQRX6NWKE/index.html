A young Welshman named Evans had entertained the company with some very beautiful Welsh airs sung in the vernacular.<br>A silence had fallen upon us, when Evans suddenly started to his feet, and cried sharply, "Who was that singing Welsh?"<br>We started in surprise. "Why," I replied, "nobody was singing at all. Besides, who knows Welsh except yourself?"<br>Evans, who looked frightened, said, "I could have sworn I heard someone singing 'Bydd mydd o ryfeddodau'."<br>"Singing what?"<br>"The Welsh resurrection hymn --the hymn was always sung at funerals in Wales."<br>Next day while carrying water across a small patch of grass, Evans stepped upon a cobra, which bit him, and in a few hours he was dead.<br><em> 一九一○年六月二十四日，《卡諾溫德拉星報》有一個英兵寫道：</em> <br>有一年聖誕節前夕，我在緬甸，和其他士兵一起，時說故事，時唱歌。一個叫埃文斯的威爾斯少年，用鄉音給大家唱了些十分悅耳的威爾斯歌曲。<br>大家靜下來之後，埃文斯突然跳起來，高聲說：「是誰在唱威爾斯歌曲？」<br>我們給他嚇了一跳。我說：「根本沒有人唱歌。而且除了你，這裏誰會說威爾斯話？」<br>埃文斯一臉驚惶，說道：「我分明聽到有人在唱Bydd mydd o ryfeddodau（《奇迹萬千》）。」<br>「唱什麼？」<br>「那是威爾斯的復活聖歌。在威爾斯，葬禮上總會唱這首歌。」<br>第二天，埃文斯提着水走過一小片草地，踏在一條眼鏡蛇上，給咬了一口，不過幾小時，就一命嗚呼。</p></body></html>
