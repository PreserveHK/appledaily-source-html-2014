Left on the field of battle, he was subsequently picked up by a party of Boers, who intended to take him prisoner.<br>When, however, they discovered that Roberts could not walk, they threw him to the ground. He sustained four broken ribs by the fall. The Boers then proceeded to rifle his pockets, despite his suffering the utmost agony. They broke one of his fingers in wrenching a ring from it, and almost stripped him in their search.<br>After his rescue, Robert's life was for a time despaired of, but he eventually recovered, though the sight of his right eye had been destroyed.<br>英國烏斯特軍團二等兵羅伯茨一八九九年十二月和波爾人交戰，挨了足足七顆子彈。他躺在戰場上，無人理會，最後有一群波爾人見到他，準備拿為戰俘。<br>但是，他們發覺羅伯茨傷得不能步行，就把他摔在地上，羅伯茨四根肋骨給撞斷，痛楚非常，那些波爾人毫不理會，就動手搜其口袋，取其所有，還恐怕有遺漏，幾乎脫去他所有衣服。羅伯茨一根指頭，也因波爾人扭奪指環而折斷。<br>羅伯茨獲救之後，醫生一度認為他命在旦夕。但他終於康復，只是右眼已經失明。</p></body></html>
