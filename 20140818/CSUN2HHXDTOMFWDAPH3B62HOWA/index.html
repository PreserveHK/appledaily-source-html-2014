He immediately rushed forward, crying, "Don't shoot! don't shoot! we have a heavy policy on him!"<br>戰場上，有不少可笑的事，稍稍可以抵消殘殺的恐怖。根據記載，以下一則趣事發生於美國南北戰爭期間。<br>北軍一個士兵的來福槍，已經瞄準南軍一名參謀，要不是那士兵的營長及時出手，這參謀就一定死於槍下。那營長在某保險公司擔任秘書，認得眼前這個驚慌失措的敵人，原來是他保險公司的顧客，而且十分富有。他連忙跑上前，高喊：「不要開槍，不要開槍，我們給了他鉅額保險！」<br>* Carnage和massacre都可以譯做「屠殺」，但兩字意思有點不同。Carnage常指戰場上殘酷的殺戮，而massacre則多指屠殺手無寸鐵或無力還擊者。所以「六四屠殺」叫June  4 Massacre，不叫carnage。</p></body></html>
